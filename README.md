# VG-DCU
Benchmark for VG-based Detection and Chart Understanding





We propose the first large-scale chart-based vector graphics dataset focusing on understanding charts. A chart is a graphical representation of data, often used to visually communicate information, relationships, trends, or patterns. Charts can be represented in two formats: raster graphics or vector graphics. Compared to raster charts, which are constructed using pixels, vector charts offer a wealth of additional information embedded in the VG file. This includes detailed text, precise coordinates, and accurate shapes of the chart elements. These characteristics significantly enhance the ease of understanding the content presented in vector charts. Moreover, vector charts enjoy broader support from both web platforms and publishers
